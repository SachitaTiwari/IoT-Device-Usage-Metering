# IoT Device Usage Metering

## ðŸ“„ Project Description
The **IoT Device Usage Metering** project aims to track and store usage metrics from connected IoT devices in a secure and decentralized manner using blockchain technology. Each IoT device can report its usage data, which is stored immutably on the Ethereum blockchain.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Vision
To enable transparent, tamper-proof, and decentralized tracking of IoT device usage â€” making data accessible, secure, and reliable for device owners, users, and service providers.

## âœ¨ Key Features
- **Decentralized Storage**: Stores usage data on-chain, preventing tampering or loss.
- **Usage Logging**: Devices can log usage events with a timestamp and data value.
- **Data Access**: Users can retrieve usage logs for auditing or analysis.

## ðŸš€ Future Scope
- **Token-Based Payments**: Integrate micropayments based on usage data (e.g., pay-per-use).
- **Multi-device Support**: Tag and categorize different devices.
- **Data Privacy Layers**: Encrypt usage data or limit access with permissions.
- **Real-time Analytics**: Build dashboards powered by usage logs.
- **Integration with IoT Platforms**: Connect directly with platforms like AWS IoT, Azure IoT, or Arduino-based devices.
